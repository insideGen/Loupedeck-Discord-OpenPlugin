# Loupedeck plugin for Discord

> This is not an official Discord plugin.

This plugin allows you to control microphone and headphone muting via keyboard shortcuts, and simulate button behavior without actual feedback.
Discord no longer offers an API (SDK deprecated, RPC in beta), so this project offers an intermediate solution.

Keyboard shortcuts are hard-coded: `Alt+F11` for the microphone and `Alt+F12` for the headphones.
